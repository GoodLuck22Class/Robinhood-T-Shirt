# robinhoodtshirts
Robinhood T-Shirts was a concept inspired by minimal clothing lines such as American Apparel. The website is able to change the colour of the displayed T-Shirt through clicking on Colourful buttons under the Purchase button. There is a modal available which shows the price of the t-shirt as well as the material, the modal window is able to be closed if the mouse is hovered near the top right corner of the window and an x is found which has to be clicked to close said window.
